# Zero Trust Dissertation Project

## Intro

The aim of this disertation was to identify whether Zero Trust Principles with IAM (Identity and Access Management) and MFA (Multi Factor Authentication) could be effective in cloud environments. To prevent the emergence of upcoming threats as companies are increasingly operating with online services. 

### **Phases:**

* Laying the Foundation: Planning and Initial Research
* Building the Foundation: Application Development and Setup
* Securing the Application: **Identity and Access Management**
* Monitoring and Threat Detection: **Initial Vulnerability Assessment**
* Hardening the System: Refinement and Post-Implementation Testing
* Measuring Success: Evaluation and Documentation
