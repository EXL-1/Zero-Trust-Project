To prevent the emergence of upcoming threats as companies are increasingly operating with online services. 

### **Phases:**

* Laying the Foundation: Planning and Initial Research
* Building the Foundation: Application Development and Setup
* Securing the Application: Identity and Access Management
* Monitoring and Threat Detection: Initial Vulnerability Assessment
* Hardening the System: Refinement and Post-Implementation Testing
* Measuring Success: Evaluation and Documentation
